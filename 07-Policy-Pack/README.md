# Policy Pack — Security Documentation

## Objective
Develop a concise set of enterprise-style security policies and incident response documentation aligned with
the NIST framework and the MITRE ATT&CK methodology, demonstrating governance, detection, and response alignment.

## Included Documents
- Logging and Monitoring Policy  
- Incident Response Plan  
- Cloud Access Control Policy  
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Sheet  

## Tools & References
- Markdown (policy documentation)
- NIST SP 800-53
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- Excel / Power BI (risk and control mapping)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Security policy writing and documentation
- Control alignment with NIST security families (AC, IR, AU)
- Threat detection mapping using MITRE ATT&CK
- Incident response planning and triage workflows
- Clear technical communication for security operations and audits

## Project Workflow
1. Draft security policies based on SOC operations and cloud security concepts.
2. Align each policy control to relevant NIST SP 800-53 control families.
3. Map detection use cases to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
4. Create a concise incident response checklist for SOC triage.
5. Publish all policies and mappings in a structured repository.

## Outcomes
- Produced three practical security policies aligned with industry standards.
- Created MITRE ATT&CK mappings for Wazuh and Azure detection use cases.
- Developed a repeatable incident response workflow applicable to future incidents.

## Next Steps
- Expand coverage to vulnerability management and backup policies.
- Add direct detection-to-policy traceability (e.g., Event ID → ATT&CK technique).
- Convert policies into reusable compliance templates for audit readiness.
