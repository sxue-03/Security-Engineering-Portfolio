# Windows Event Logs for Security Investigations

## Purpose
This document explains how Windows Event Logs are used during security monitoring,
alert triage, and incident response. The focus is on understanding which logs matter,
what types of activity they capture, and how they support investigations.

This file provides log-level context and complements:
- Windows-Event-IDs.md (quick reference)
- Windows-Authentication-and-Privilege-Events.md (investigation logic)

## Core Windows Event Logs

### Security Log
The Security log is the most critical log source for detecting attacks.

It records:
- Authentication successes and failures
- Privilege assignments
- Account and group changes
- Process creation (when enabled)

This log is heavily used for:
- Brute force detection
- Credential abuse investigation
- Privilege escalation analysis

### System Log
The System log records operating system and service-level activity.

It includes:
- Service start and stop events
- Driver and system errors
- Unexpected shutdowns or restarts

Security relevance:
- Identifying persistence mechanisms
- Detecting service-based abuse
- Providing context around suspicious authentication events

---

### Application Log
The Application log records events generated by applications.

It includes:
- Application crashes
- Application-specific errors
- Security-relevant behavior from monitored software

Security relevance:
- Identifying exploitation attempts
- Correlating application failures with network or authentication activity

## Log Collection and Visibility
In enterprise environments, Windows Event Logs are typically:
- Forwarded to a SIEM
- Centralized for correlation
- Retained for incident response and compliance

Centralized logging enables:
- Cross-host correlation
- Timeline reconstruction
- Detection of lateral movement

## Common Investigation Workflow
During an alert, analysts typically:
1. Identify the relevant event log (Security, System, Application)
2. Locate events around the alert timestamp
3. Correlate log entries with network and host telemetry
4. Identify authentication, privilege, or execution patterns

Logs are analyzed as sequences, not isolated events.

## Log Configuration Considerations
Effective detection depends on proper configuration.

Important considerations:
- Ensure Security logging is enabled and retained
- Enable process creation logging where possible
- Forward logs in near real time
- Protect logs from tampering or deletion

Misconfigured logging can create blind spots during incidents.

## Portfolio Relevance
This document supports:
- SIEM log ingestion and correlation
- Windows authentication and privilege investigations
- Attack scenario walkthroughs
- Incident response documentation and reporting
