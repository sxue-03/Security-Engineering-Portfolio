# Security Engineering Portfolio

This repository is a unified security engineering portfolio showcasing hands-on projects across
log analysis, SIEM alerting, threat intelligence, incident response, cloud security, and policy design.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I work as a security engineer:
understanding attacks, detecting malicious activity, responding to incidents,
and designing preventative security controls.
