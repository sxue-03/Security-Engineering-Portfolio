# Security Engineering Portfolio (Monorepo)

This repository contains my hands-on security engineering projects covering:
networking fundamentals, Windows/Linux security, SIEM alerting, threat intelligence,
incident response, and policy documentation.

## Quick Navigation
- 00 Knowledge Map → how everything connects
- 01 Network & OS Fundamentals → practical notes + references
- 02 Log Analyzer → log parsing and suspicious pattern analysis
- 03 SIEM Alerting Lab → detection rules and alert triage
- 04 Wazuh All-in-One → centralized logging + endpoint detections
- 05 Threat Intelligence Lab → IOC enrichment + MITRE mapping
- 06 Incident Report Generator → structured incident documentation
- 07 Policy Pack → NIST-aligned policies + control mappings

## End-to-End Scenario
See `attack-scenarios/brute-force-to-ir.md` for a complete workflow:
policy → logs → detection → MITRE → incident response.
